# Data Engineering Portfolio

This is a portfolio repository about projects I worked on during my final semester at AltSchool as a data engineering student..

## Projects

1. Alpha Project: This project provides a setup to use Docker Compose to create a PostgreSQL image and run a Python script to execute SQL files against the PostgreSQL database. The goal is to simplify the development and testing of SQL scripts in a consistent environment.
