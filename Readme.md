# Data Engineering Portfolio

This is a portfolio repository about projects I worked on during my final semester at AltSchool as a data engineering student.

## Projects

1. Alpha Project: This project provides a setup to use Docker Compose to create a PostgreSQL image and run a Python script to execute SQL files against the PostgreSQL database. The goal is to simplify the development and testing of SQL scripts in a consistent environment.

2.Project 2: Interacting with GCS and Bigquery from Python
This project is enables one to interact programmaticaly with Google Big Query and Google cloud bucket using Python. This project involves two actions:

1.  Writing an API to a google cloud bucket as JSON file and then loading the JSON file from the bucket into google big query.
2.  Loading a CSV file from local storage to google bigquery.
