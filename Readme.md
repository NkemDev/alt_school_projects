# My Data Engineering Portfolio

This is a portfolio repository about projects I worked on during my final semester at AltSchool as a data engineering student.

## Projects
Alpha Project: This project involves setting up a PostgreSQL database using Docker Compose and executing an SQL script using Python. The purpose is to automate the creation of a PostgreSQL container, initialize the database, and run SQL commands.
